# NERC Deployments

Here lives manifests and configuration values for our deployments on NERC.

Nothing is automated. It'd be nice to set up ArgoCD someday but that day is not today.

Make sure not to upload secrets in here!

Some documentation _might_ be found here: https://chrisproject.org/docs/internal/nerc

## Notes

Use `helmfile sync` instead of `helmfile apply`. See https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff/issues/460#issuecomment-1642653675
